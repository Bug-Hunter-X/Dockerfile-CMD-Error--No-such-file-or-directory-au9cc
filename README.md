This repository demonstrates a common error when using the CMD instruction in a Dockerfile to run a Python application. The issue arises when the main Python script lacks a shebang, making it difficult for the interpreter to find the entry point of the application. The solution involves adding a shebang to the Python file and making sure the execution permissions are set correctly within the Docker image.
